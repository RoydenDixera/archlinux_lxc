# Attention
Latest pyload-ng is still having issues with https, making the webinterface inaccessible.\
My script however automatically enables HTTPS during installation, so you might need to disable it afterwards.

# pyLoad Arch Linux installation (run as root user inside the LXC)

### 1. Run the script inside of the Arch Linux LXC.

  ```
  bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheHellSite/archlinux_lxc/main/pyload/pyload_installer.sh)
  ```
